# Movie-Finder
Simple app that gives some info about a movie using RapidAPI, the working app can be found [here](https://davidedm99.github.io/Movie-Info/).<br>

Now are shown all the streaming services available and the background changes based on the searched movie, need some styling with css but for now it works fine :octocat:
