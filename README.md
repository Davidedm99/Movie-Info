# Movie-Finder
Simple app that gives some info about a movie using OMDb API, the working app can be found [here](https://davidedm99.github.io/Movie-Finder/) but still need some work to do.<br>

I would like to filter disambiguation and use an interactive background but, for now, it does what it needs to do. :octocat:
